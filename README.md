# README

This is my first attempt at a port of the .kdb project (PyPI package kmerdb) to rust.


# Usage


Development

```bash
cargo run -- -h
```



# Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank my parents and family for the education that I got, even if I decided to waste my time with the damn rust community.

The performance concerns mostly stem from my poorly designed hybrid architecture of a database app that supports a CLI format. In practice the final result is what we want in the database anyways, and I cannot even define my hypotheses at this point because the unsupervised space is too abstract for me to understand between the Clostridia.

So I'm writing more software instead of doing more biology at the moment, but it might be a good enough effort to start getting the performance I need.
